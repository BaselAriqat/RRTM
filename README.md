# RRT
RRTM is a program written in C# that simulates the classic RRT ( Rapidly Exploring Random Trees ) and its variation RRTConnect (or RRTExtend), in a workspace that the user can change and modify.

#### This project provides:

* two motion planning algorithms:
  1. RRT.
  2. RRTConnect.


* Two nearest neighbor search algorithms:
  1. Linear nearest neighbor.
  2. KDTree nearest neighbor.


* Two robot configurations:
  1. ‘Point’ Robot (2 dimensional robot) consist of (x, y).
  2. ‘Stick’ Robot (3 dimensional robot) consist of (x, y, θ).
